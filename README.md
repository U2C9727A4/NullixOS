# NullixOS
An immutable linux distribution based on void linux

# Licensing
The project is licensed under GPLV3 but some aprts of void linux use diffirent licenses. I do not wish to affect those licenses, They are still there as normal and **are not GPL**. Everything that i make however (Such as installation scripts and stuff)
are all licensed under GPLV3.
